	                    	<p class="novecento">Have your questions not yet been addressed? Look below to find your question! Did we still not answer your question? Feel free to <a class="email-link" href="mailto:rodenbeck.britta@gmail.com">e-mail us</a> with your question.</p>
	                	<h3 class="novecento">Are children allowed?</h3>
	                		<p class="novecento">No children under the age of 13 are invited to the wedding. We preemptively apologize for the inconvenience this decision might cause, but we hope that with being upfront about this, you will be able to find a sitter or alternative for that date. It's not that we don't love your children. We simply do not have the money or space to accommodate them. Plus, this will give you an opportunity to let loose on the dance floor and have an extra drink on us!</p>
	            		<h3 class="novecento">Can we photograph the ceremony?</h3>
	            			<p class="novecento">We have hired these two absolutely stunning and amazing photographers, Brit and Cole of <a class="email-link" href="http://indigophotography.us">Indigo Photography</a>, that will photograph the entire event, from getting ready to the end of the reception. Because of this, we have decided to have an unplugged ceremony. You are more than welcome to take pictures at any other point of the day. To understand why we have decided to have an unplugged ceremony, look at this <a class="email-link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bridal-guide/why-you-might-want-to-con_b_3331528.html">super horrifying blog post.</a></p>
	        			<h3 class="novecento">What should I wear?</h3>
	        				<p class="novecento">Well, what are you comfortable in? Britta doesn’t care what you wear.  Her philosophy is that if you decide to look ridiculous, we will have some fantastic professional photos to show you looking ridiculous for the rest of your life.  Luke would prefer that we tell you to dress at least business casual.  So you can roll the dice on that one.  It’s probably a good bet that you don’t wear some kind of white dress though, but hey!  That’s up to you as well.</p>
	    				<h3 class="novecento">Is there an open bar?</h3>
	    					<p class="novecento">There is an open bar including beer, wine, and liquor. We do, however, suggest bringing some cash to tip your bartenders. They are making themselves available for almost six hours so that you can have drinks all night long. <a class="email-link" href="http://www.abccatering.net/">ABC Catering</a> is providing the food and the bar for the night.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">How do I get to Klehm?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">Klehm Arboretum is located on the southwest side of Rockford, Illinois. From US-20, located conveniently near the hotel district of Rockford, you will take the IL-2 N/Main Street exit. After about a mile and a half, turn onto Clifton Avenue. Klehm Arboretum will be on the left, just a few feet from the turn.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">Do I have to pay admission or for parking?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">You do not! One of the great things about having our wedding at Klehm means that all of our guests get free admission to the entire park on the evening and night of our wedding. Once you enter the park, there is a parking lot to the right when looking at the Visitor's Center. Come on inside for a drink before the ceremony, and then we will have everyone walk down to the ceremony area on the grounds together.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">Can I bring a date?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">Due to our budgetary constraints, we are only allowing a guest if one has been specified on your invitation. If you are unsure if you are given a date, please feel free to <a class="email-link" href="mailto:rodenbeck.britta@gmail.com">contact us</a>! We have made sure that our guests know at least one other person invited, and we encourage everyone to mingle and meet new people.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">Where should I stay if I am from out of town?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">We have a block of rooms reserved at a discounted rate for the convenience of our guests at both Radisson Hotel and Candlewood Suites. For more information on these hotels, look at the page detailing <a class="email-link" href="ourcity.html">our city</a>. There are also several other hotels in the area including Hilton Garden Inn, Fairfield Inn and Suites, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn, and more. If you prefer one of these hotels, we probably won't be offended.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">Can I bring a pet?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">Another great thing about having our wedding at Klehm Arboretum is that your furry friends can join us on the day! Now, there are a few things to consider first. The pets are not allowed in the Visitor's Center. This means that when we are having dinner and enjoying some dancing inside the center, your dog or cat or pig or hamster will need to be outdoors. Additionally, if it rains, our ceremony will also be indoors, and your pup might be left outside, soaking wet and miserable. If you can think of a way to ensure these aren't problems for your pet, by all means bring them! Candlewood Suites allows pets overnight for just a small fee. If you would rather kennel your pet, we recommend <a class="email-link" href="https://www.meyerspetcare.com/">Meyer's Pet Care</a> in Belvidere, Illinois.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">Is there anything untraditional about this wedding that we should prepare ourselves for?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">We are planning quite a few untraditional things, but not many will have a huge bearing on you. Something new we are doing, however, is holding a cocktail hour before our ceremony. We are hoping our guests can come up to an hour early and join us for a drink before we recite our vows! You can even bring your drink to the ceremony and join us for a special toast. Aside from this untraditional itinerary mix-up, we will be having entertainment alternatives to dancing, weather permitting, after dinner. There will be a plethora of outdoor games to play.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">How can I support Klehm Arboretum?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">I like you! I'm happy you're considering helping a Rockford institution. To donate to Klehm, visit their <a class="email-link" href="http://www.klehm.org/get-involved/donate/#.Vr5LmZMrKRs">donation page</a>. You can also volunteer or buy a membership at that site.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">Is Koshka coming?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">No, she is not coming. Please stop asking.</p>
						<h3 class="novecento">I have a question that has not been answered here. How can I contact you?</h3>
							<p class="novecento">If you already have some contact information for one of us, that would be a wonderful place to start. Otherwise, feel free to <a class="email-link" href="mailto:rodenbeck.britta@gmail.com">e-mail Britta here</a>, and she will get back to you quickly!</p>
